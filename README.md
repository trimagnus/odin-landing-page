# Odin Landing Page
This is a static website using just HTML and CSS, but it demonstrates many
of the techniques learned in the course to this point (and a few new ones).
A hero section at the top with logo and nav, main content section, a call
to action, and a footer. We are provided some of the styling requirements 
and a sample image.
